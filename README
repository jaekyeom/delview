vim has the ability to save and load views with the mkview/loadview files, which are used in some tips as such:

  au BufWinLeave ?* mkview
  au BufWinEnter ?* silent loadview

Unfortunately there is one piece of functionality missing, the ability to delete or clear these views.  Currently you need to either use ':autoload edit <file>' to open the file without a view and then save that as a new view, or else you need to figure out where the vim 'views' directory is and manually delete the files with a file explorer or shell.

This script gives you the simple command to delete the views for the current buffer:

  :delview
